# XPand Music

A project made for EDC (Engenharia de Dados e Conhecimento) course of MIECT, at DETI-UA.

Our goal is to put in practise the subjects learned throughout the course, mainly Django and the use of XML, XML Schema, XPath and XSLT.

So, our idea is to use Last.fm XML API to fetch data from the artists, songs, albuns and charts. Basically fetching information through the API and display it as we like.

Developers and collaborators:
- Cristiano Vagos (cristianovagos@ua.pt)
- Andr√© Nascimento (andrenascimento@ua.pt)

External plugins added:
- BaseX (sudo apt-get install basex)
